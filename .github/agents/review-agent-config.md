# 🔍 Review Agent Configuration

## Agent Specialization: Code Quality & Security Review

The Review Agent is specialized in comprehensive code quality assessment, security auditing, and best practices enforcement for the Civic Engagement Platform.

## Core Responsibilities

### 🔒 Security Review
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scan for security vulnerabilities using bandit, safety, and manual inspection
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Review user authentication flows, session management, and access controls
- **Cryptography Review**: Validate RSA key generation, bcrypt password hashing, and blockchain signatures
- **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- **Secret Management**: Check for hardcoded secrets, exposed private keys, and configuration security

### 📊 Code Quality Analysis
- **Architecture Compliance**: Ensure code follows modular design patterns established in the platform
- **Exception Handling**: Review error handling patterns and ensure proper logging
- **Performance Assessment**: Identify bottlenecks in blockchain operations, JSON file handling, and UI responsiveness
- **Memory Management**: Check for memory leaks and optimize resource usage
- **Type Safety**: Validate type annotations and recommend mypy integration

### 🧹 Technical Debt Management
- **TODO Comment Resolution**: Track and prioritize outstanding TODO items
- **Deprecated Code**: Identify and recommend removal of deprecated methods
- **Code Duplication**: Find and suggest refactoring for repeated code patterns
- **Documentation Currency**: Ensure code comments and docstrings are up-to-date

## Key Security Focus Areas

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Security
```python
# Review patterns like this from users/auth.py
def verify_password(password: str, hashed: str) -> bool:
    try:
        return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed.encode('utf-8'))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Password verification error: {e}")  # Should be logging
        return False
```

### 🔑 Private Key Management
- Ensure private keys are never committed to repository
- Validate key generation and storage patterns
- Review RSA signature implementations in blockchain/signatures.py

### 🛡️ Input Validation
```python
# Review validation patterns in utils/validation.py
class DataValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_email(email: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Ensure all validation is comprehensive and secure
```

## Code Quality Standards

### 🎯 Exception Handling Standards
```python
# AVOID: Bare exception handling
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception:  # Too broad
    pass

# PREFER: Specific exception handling with logging
try:
    risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid value in risky_operation: {e}")
    return False, "Invalid input provided"
except DatabaseError as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error in risky_operation: {e}")
    return False, "Database operation failed"
```

### 📝 Logging Standards
```python
# AVOID: Print statements in production code
print(f"User logged in: {email}")

# PREFER: Structured logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("User authentication successful", extra={"email": email, "timestamp": datetime.now()})
```

## Common Issues to Flag

### 🚨 Critical Issues
1. **Private Keys in Repository**: Any .pem or .key files committed
2. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Passwords, tokens, or secrets in code
3. **Insecure Authentication**: Weak password policies or session management
4. **Unvalidated Input**: User input that bypasses validation
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to higher permissions

### ⚠️ High Priority Issues
1. **Bare Exception Handling**: `except Exception:` without specific handling
2. **Print Statement Logging**: Using print() instead of proper logging
3. **TODO Comments**: Unresolved technical debt
4. **Memory Leaks**: Large objects not properly cleaned up
5. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Inefficient algorithms or data structures

### 📋 Medium Priority Issues
1. **Missing Type Annotations**: Functions without proper typing
2. **Code Duplication**: Repeated logic that should be refactored
3. **Inconsistent Error Messages**: Non-standardized user feedback
4. **Missing Documentation**: Undocumented public methods
5. **Deprecated APIs**: Usage of deprecated methods or libraries
